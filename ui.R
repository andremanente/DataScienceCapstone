                             <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:18px">How the Algorithm Works</span>
                             <p>The algorithm searches a 6-gram model and uses Stupid Backoff to search lower-order N-grams if the higher-order N-gram does not occur in the model. When searching the 6-gram, the 
                             algorithm searches the last 5 words of the user\'s input phrase in a data frame containing the N-grams and their frequencies/probabilities. If the 5-word phrase occurs in the data frame
                             of 6-grams, the algorithm returns the subset of words that complete the phrase. If the 5-word phrase does not occur in the 6-grams, then Stupid Backoff is performed to search for the 
                             4-word phrase in the 5-grams. If the algorithm backs off completely and finds no occurences of a single word in the 2-grams, then the most common single words are returned. 
                             For example, if the phrase <b>"The chair she sat in, like a burnished"</b> is input, the search string is the last 5 words, <b>"sat in like a burnished"</b>. The search would go as follows:
                             <ul>
                             <li>"sat in like a burnished" : <span style="color:red">0 results</span>
                             <li>"in like a burnished" : <span style="color:red">0 results</span>
                             <li>"like a burnished" : <span style="color:red">0 results</span>
                             <li>"a burnished" : <span style="color:red">0 results</span>
                             <li>"burnished" : <span style="color:green">1 result</span>, <b>"the"</b>
                             </ul><br>
                             <p>Unfortunately, the algorithm got this prediction wrong, as the actual next word of this line from T.S. Eliot\'s <em>The Wasteland</em> is <b>"throne"</b>. Certainly, this line is 
                             fairly uncommon. The prediction algorithm can\'t be expected to give perfect results, but it does a decent job of giving plausible next words most of the time. Below are more details of the algorithm\'s
                             step-by-step process:</p>                             
                             <ol>
                             <li>Get the length (<var>m</var>) of the clean text string (<var>x</var>) and feed it into a for-loop <code>for (i in m:1)</code> where <var>m</var> is controlled to be less than or equal to 5. Each iteration of the for-loop does:</li>
                             <ul>
                             <li>Split <var>x</var> where spaces occur.</li>
                             <li>Get the length (<var>n</var>) of <var>x</var></li>
                             <li>Select a subset of <var>x</var> defined by <code>x[(n-i+1):n]</code>. As the for-loop advances (meaning no instances of the string were found), <var>i</var> decreases, resulting in a lower-order N-gram to be used in the search.</li>
                             <li>Search corresponding N-gram list for occurences of <var>x</var>. For example, if <var>x</var> has length 5, search 6-grams; if length 4, search 5-grams. Save search results.</li>
                             <li>If the search returned zero results, go to the next loop iteration. Otherwise, break out of the loop.</li>
                             </ul>
                             <li>Subset the N-gram list by the search results and arrange them in descending order by frequency.</li>
                             <li>Extract the list of words that complete the search string <var>x</var>.</li>
                             <li>Return the top word(s) according to the user\'s desired maximum.</li>

                                  <p style="text-indent: 25px">This application was created for the final assignment of the Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization Capstone Project through <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science"><b>Coursera.org</b></a>.
                                  All natural language processing tasks were done in RStudio using the R packages <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=tm"><b>tm</b></a> and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=quanteda"><b>quanteda</b></a>.
                                  Other packages that were utilized were <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr"><b>dplyr</b></a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=stringi"><b>stringi</b></a>, 
                                  <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=data.table"><b>data.table</b></a>, and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=filehash"><b>filehash</b></a>.</p>

                                  <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:18px">The Data</span>
                                  <p style="text-indent: 25px">The texts for this project come from <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip">this dataset</a>. The data are approximately 4 million lines of
                                  text from blogs, online news publications, and Twitter posts. Incorporating texts from varied sources probably lowers prediction accuracy compared to training a model and predicting for a specific
                                  genre of text. However, using texts from sources with varied styles of writing and vocabulary makes the prediction algorithm more generalizable.</p>
                                  <br>
                                  <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:18px">Other Details</span>
                                  <p style="text-indent: 25px">The texts were split into 60% training, 20% development, and 20% test sets. The training set was further split equally into training and holdout sets. The holdout
                                  set is necessary for some smoothing techniques and methods for dealing with unseen words. However, for the current prediction algorithm, only simple Good-Turing smoothing was performed on the
                                  counts of the N-grams of lengths 1 to 6. The N-gram lists were "pruned" to only include the top 5 completions for each N-gram, since that is the maximum number of results the algorithm returns 
                                  and it reduces file size and search time.
                                  </p>
                                  <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:18px">Performance</span>
                                  <p style="text-indent: 25px">Below is the accuracy of the two models. <em>smooth_trim5_prune</em> only includes N-grams that have a raw count of greater than 5. Similarly, <em>smooth_trim1_prune</em> includes only N-grams that occur more than once. The two 
                                  models have fairly similar accuracy, but the smaller model was about 6 times faster. Both perform reasonably well for the purposes of this application, but could certainly be faster.
                                  The bottleneck was identified as the part of the algorithm that searches the N-gram lists. Perhaps lookup tables or a more efficient use of data.tables would improve the speed.</p>'),
